    <p><h1>Making Music</h1></p>
    <p>One of things I enjoy more than most is music. I along with my lovey wife have the pleasure of playing music together. We met through music as performers on cruise ships and now have the privilege of continuing our passions and <strong>making music</strong> together </p>
<p>Some of our recent endeavors on our musical journey are (but not limited to): </p>
<ul>

<li>Performing at weddings and corporate events with our trio. Click on image below for some of our videos!<a href="https://www.coastalcollectivemusic.com/" title="Coastal Website"> "Coastal Collective"</a></li>
